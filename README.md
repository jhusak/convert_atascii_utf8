# convert_atascii_utf8

Toolset to convert ATASCII files with negative characters (as in Action!, where they do as comment) to/from UTF8 for editing with favourite text editor.

However, inversed chars cannot be entered from keyboard, only from char picker.

In addition a special font:

    TrueType/EightBit%20Atari-Standard.ttf

is needed (and installed in the system) from repository:

    https://github.com/a8bit/EightBit-Atari-Fonts/
